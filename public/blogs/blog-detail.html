<p class="story-body-text">Apple and Amazon customers were notified on Tuesday of opportunities to get money back as a result of two legal settlements with the government. Both cases revolved around Apple.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Apple emailed customers eligible for a refund related to a federal complaint that children could make purchases in iPhone or iPad apps without adequate parental consent. In January, Apple reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/technology/government-and-apple-settle-childrens-app-purchase-inquiry.html?_r=0">pay at least $32.5 million in refunds</a>.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">In another email, Amazon notified customers about store credit they received for e-book purchases, a result of a settlement reached with five major book publishers.&nbsp;In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/technology/e-book-antitrust-case-against-apple-to-begin.html">antitrust lawsuit</a> filed in 2012, the Justice Department had accused the publishers of conspiring with Apple to raise the average price of e-book titles. The publishers agreed to pay a total of $166 million.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Customers who bought an e-book published by Simon &amp; Schuster, Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan or Penguin from April 1, 2010, to May 21, 2012, are getting a credit of $3.17 for each book that was on the New York Times best-seller list; for books not on the list, customers get a credit of $0.73 per title.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">“Illegal actions by these publishers forced consumers in New York and across the nation to pay artificially inflated prices for e-books,” Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, said in a statement.&nbsp;“Companies engaging in such anticompetitive conduct will be punished &mdash; and starting today, those injured by their actions will start to receive full and fair compensation.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text">Apple chose to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/technology/judge-rules-against-apple-in-e-books-trial.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;hp">fight the Justice Department last summer</a>&nbsp;in a Manhattan courtroom, and lost. But it continues to contest the decision by filing&nbsp;<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/court-rejects-apple-appeal-in-e-book-case/">appeals</a> and <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/13/secretive-apple-squirms-in-gaze-of-u-s-monitor/">pushing back against the lawyer</a> assigned to monitor its activities.</p>
<p class="story-body-text">For parents affected by unauthorized in-app purchases, Apple customers can <a href="http://getsupport.apple.com/GetSolutions.do">fill out a form online</a> to apply for a refund. For the e-books settlement, Amazon customers will automatically receive store credit.</p>
